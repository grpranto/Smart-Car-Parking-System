<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project
This project was a part of my Bachelor's course in Microprocessors and Microcontrollers. We developed a smart parking system using Arduino, where the entry gate only opens for registered cars if there are available parking slots. If all parking slots are occupied, the entry gate remains closed.
